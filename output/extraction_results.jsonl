Its central principle is to enable seamless integration between natural language and programming by treating language as functions. Through the introduction of Object-Oriented Prompting, Langfun empowers users to prompt LLMs using objects and types, offering enhanced control and simplifying agent development.\n\nTo unlock the magic of Langfun, you can start with Langfun 101. Notably, Langfun is compatible with popular LLMs such as Gemini, GPT, Claude, all without the need for additional fine-tuning.\n", "document_id": "doc_8a52205f"}
