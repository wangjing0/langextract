While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest,\nit sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model’s activation space—persona vectors—underlying several traits, such as\nevil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant’s personality at deployment time.\nWe then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes\nafter finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in\nthe first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality\nchanges, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait\nof interest, given only a natural-language description\n", "document_id": "doc_a6fb9088"}
